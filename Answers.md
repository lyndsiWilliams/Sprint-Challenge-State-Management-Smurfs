1. What problem does the context API help solve?

  - Context API simplifies state management.

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

  - Actions describe how the state is going to change. Reducers respond to actions and update the state. The store is a JavaScript object that represents everything that changes within the application. The store's universal change representation is why it is known as a 'single source of truth'.

3. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

  - Application state is passed top-down from parent to child, while Component state is stored on a context object which can be plugged into any other components. It seems that using Component state is going to be the best option in most cases, but I think it would be simpler to use Application state if the state won't be leaving the component.

4. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

  - Redux-thunk provides more security in your application functionality. It intercepts your actions before it reaches the reducer and is essentially a "filter". It can stop an action, dispatch a different (or multiple) actions, or forward the action untouched.

5. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

  - Surprisingly, once I actually figured out Redux it became my favorite state management system. It's complicated at first but once you learn the nuances it's definitely a very powerful system that's worth the wild learning curve.
